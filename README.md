# HTML5Apps
This is a playground for simple HTML5 and JavaScript apps. The apps explore features available in HTML5 and JavaScript. They may be not perfect, but should be useful in one way or another. When they reach a kind of stable phase, I merge them over to the gh-pages branch, which makes them available on the web.
